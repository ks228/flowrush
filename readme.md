# Flow Rush

Flow Rush is minimalistic logic puzzle game. The game was released on Android&trade; platform. This game was built with the [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) engine (the main gameplay released with help of scene2D).

It's some modification of 'plumber'-game. Your task is to deliver all messages to the destination points. To solve the puzzle, you should rotate and connect hex tiles in such a way as to find the right path for a delivery of abstract messages.

It's the first project of [blackhornet.workshop](https://blackhor.net) and we'll glad to get any feedbacks and remarks.

## Why open-source?

We have learnt a lot from the open code out there and this is our small token to repay the love. We think that sharing and transperency can lead to superior experience in this area.

You are free to use and change code in a way as you want. Just don't release the same app.
